# teacher-helper
 This is the source code for a discord bot to move members between channels.
 
 It was built using the Discord and Discord.js libraries. 
 
 ## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run discord bot
$ node index.js

# Add the bot to your server by heading to:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=751089692153348118&permissions=0&scope=bot
```

Note: Commands only work if the user has the role of "Teacher" (or "teacher"), and if the user is in the channel with the users being moved.
